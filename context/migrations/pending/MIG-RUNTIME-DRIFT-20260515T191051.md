# Migration MIG-RUNTIME-DRIFT-20260515T191051

## Drifted managed runtime files (Variant 3 — BR-CLEANUP-ARCH item 6)

The following managed `.aibox-home/` runtime files have been modified on the host and match **neither** the current canonical aibox generation **nor** any known archived template snapshot. They may represent intentional user customisations.

`aibox apply` left these files **untouched**. Review each one and decide whether to preserve the local edit or restore the canonical generated content.

## Per-file recommendations

| file | reason-for-classification | recommendation |
|------|--------------------------|----------------|
| `.aibox-home/.claude.json` | content matches neither current canonical nor any archived snapshot | review-manually |

## How to resolve

For each file above, choose one of:
- **`preserve-as-is`** — keep your local edit; mark this migration applied.
- **`overwrite-with-canonical`** — run `aibox apply --force-runtime-file <path>` (once that flag ships) or manually copy the canonical content from `context/templates/aibox-home/<version>/<path>`.
- **`review-manually`** — compare live vs canonical using your diff tool and cherry-pick the parts you want to keep.
