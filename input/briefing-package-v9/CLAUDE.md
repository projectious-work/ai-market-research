# AI Market Briefing — Project Context

## What this repo is

A self-updating intelligence dashboard tracking the AI model and tooling landscape, focused on decisions Bernhard needs to make. A scheduled GitHub Action runs `claude -p` daily against `briefing-prompt.md` to update `dashboard.html`.

## User profile

**Bernhard** — technically sophisticated developer, AI infrastructure focus.

- Currently on **Claude Max 5×** ($100/mo) — primary interactive coding tool
- Self-hosted GPU: **2× A6000 (96GB VRAM total)** on Vast.ai (Docker-based, no upfront capex)
- Considering: dual subscription (Claude Max + OpenAI Pro), additional MacBook Pro hardware
- Uses Claude Code in Docker dev containers (so cron-on-host won't work — hence GitHub Actions)
- Builds custom agentic multi-model systems
- Reads benchmarks closely; catches inconsistencies; pushes for precision

## Investigation aspects tracked

1. **Frontier models** — subscriptions, API pricing, benchmarks (esp. SWE-bench Pro), quota burn vs Opus 4.7, context windows, automated agent ToS. Full OpenAI GPT family tracked: 5.5, 5.5 Pro, 5.4, 5.4 Mini, 5.4 Nano, 5.3-Codex, 5.3-Codex-Spark, 5.2, plus legacy Codex variants behind a filter.
2. **Quota burn cross-matrix** — sub-section of Models tab. Model × reasoning-effort matrix for OpenAI (`/effort` levels), Anthropic (extended thinking), Google (thinking budgets). Baseline = GPT-5.5 medium = 1.00×. Tracks `data.quota_burn_matrix` in JSON.
3. **Agent harnesses** — Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Aider, Cline, Roo Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Goose, OMO, OpenClaw, CCR, Hermes
4. **Self-hosting** — Vast.ai cloud GPU configs, MacBook configs (M4 Pro 64GB, M5 Max 128GB, Air 32GB), open-weight models (Gemma 4, Qwen 3, Llama 3.1, MiniMax M2.5, DeepSeek V3.2), quantization formats, frameworks (llama.cpp, vLLM, Ollama, MLX)
5. **Strategy** — derived recommendations spanning the above

## Reference model

Default reference for quality % comparisons: **Opus 4.7** (switchable in UI to Sonnet 4.6, GPT-5.4, Haiku 4.5, etc.).

## Key principles to preserve in updates

- **SWE-bench Verified is contaminated** (~80–89% scores). SWE-bench Pro is the trustworthy benchmark. Always show both, but lead with Pro.
- **Subscriptions beat API for power users** because cache reads are flat-rate. Don't drop this point.
- **Memory bandwidth is the bottleneck** on Apple Silicon, not compute.
- **MoE models** (active vs total params) deliver better quality-per-VRAM than dense.
- **`claude -p` is first-party** — subscription-eligible, not API-only.
- **Anthropic OAuth blocked third-party harnesses on April 4, 2026** — affected: OpenCode, Goose, Cline, Roo Code with OAuth. API key still works.
- **Jurisdiction matters** — track US / EU / China per model, surface in UI.
- **Codex pricing migrated to token-based on April 2, 2026** — burn matrix ratios derive from API list pricing, not per-message averages. Update accordingly when prices shift.
- **Reasoning tokens count as output** — that's why high/xhigh effort burns so much (output is ~6× input price).

## Burn matrix maintenance

When models change, update both `data.models` AND `data.quota_burn_matrix`:

- New OpenAI or Anthropic model → add row with effort-level multipliers (low/medium/high/xhigh; Anthropic adds max). Compute `medium` cell as `(api_in × 0.3 + api_out × 0.7) / (5 × 0.3 + 30 × 0.7)` to ground it in API pricing relative to the unit anchor (gpt-5.5 medium = 1.00). Then scale: low ≈ 0.4×medium, high ≈ 1.7×medium, xhigh ≈ 2.7×medium, max ≈ 5×medium (Anthropic only).
- New Google model → add to `google_matrix` with `off / low / medium / high` budget tiers.
- **Effort vocabulary is shared between OpenAI and Anthropic**: low/medium/high/xhigh. Anthropic Opus 4.7 also has 'max' (~5× medium, ~2× xhigh). Sonnet 4.6 has low/medium/high/max but no xhigh. Haiku 4.5 has no effort control.
- Anthropic's old API (`thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}`) is **deprecated since Opus 4.6**. Adaptive thinking via effort is the current model. Don't model the old budget_tokens API anywhere.

## Unit anchor vs displayed reference (v1.2.1+)

The burn matrix uses two distinct concepts that the daily briefing job MUST keep distinct:

1. **Unit anchor (stored values)** — every cell in `openai_matrix`, `anthropic_matrix`, `google_matrix` stores an absolute burn value anchored to `gpt-5.5 medium = 1.00`. This anchor NEVER changes — it's the unit of storage. If GPT-5.5 is replaced as the SWE-Pro leader, the unit anchor still stays at "gpt-5.5 medium" so daily archives remain numerically comparable across time.

2. **Displayed reference (UI dropdown)** — the user picks a reference model in the top-right dropdown. At render time, every displayed burn ratio is computed as `stored_value / reference_model_unit`. This is purely a display transform — the JSON values don't change.

**What this means for the briefing job:**
- When updating burn values, always compute them against gpt-5.5 medium = 1.00, not against whatever reference happens to be selected in the UI.
- Never try to "rebase" the matrix to a new anchor. The whole point of separating unit anchor from displayed reference is that the daily archives stay comparable.
- Avoid hardcoded text like "0.5× of GPT-5.5 medium" in row notes — when the user picks a different reference, that text becomes stale. Instead, use neutral framing like "fixed-rate model" or "deprecated for new work."

## Efficiency leaders panel (v1.2.0+)

The Models tab includes an Efficiency Leaders panel below the burn matrix. It auto-derives top 10 cross-provider model+effort combinations from the matrix and the effort_quality_factors. The daily briefing job does not need to maintain this panel directly — it updates automatically whenever burn values, model SWE-Pro scores, or effort_quality_factors change.

- `data.quota_burn_matrix.effort_quality_factors` stores the assumed quality multipliers per effort level. Defaults: minimal=0.65, low=0.80, medium=0.92, high=0.98, xhigh=1.00, max=1.00. Adjust if community measurements change (kentgigger, productcompass, mindstudio are the sources). A change here propagates through every quality % in the dashboard and re-ranks the leaders panel.
- Quality % per cell = `(model_swe_pro / reference_swe_pro × effort_quality_factor) × 100`.
- Efficiency score = `displayed_burn ÷ (quality / 100)`, where displayed_burn is post-reference-division.

## Task-fit recommendations (v1.3.0+)

The Strategy tab includes a Task-fit Recommendations table: 10 task types × 4 providers (Anthropic / OpenAI / Google / Self-hosted), one pick per cell with runner-ups surfaced on click.

`data.strategy.task_fit.rows[]` — each row has `task`, `description`, `recommendations` (keyed by provider), and `runner_up_per_provider` (keyed by provider). Each recommendation has `model_id`, `effort`, and `rationale`. The burn × ratio shown in each cell is derived from the burn matrix at render time, so it follows the reference dropdown automatically.

**Maintenance principle**: when refreshing daily, the briefing job reconsiders the full roster for each row × provider combination. Picks shift as models improve, prices drop, or new releases arrive. The roster is the *pool* the briefing chooses from; the table shows the *picks*. Runners-up document what was considered but not picked.

- If a new model is released, add it to `data.models` and then reconsider every task-fit row's recommendations against it.
- If a recommended model is deprecated or removed, find every task-fit cell that references it and pick a replacement from the roster.
- Empty cells (e.g. "self_hosted: not recommended for hard debugging") are intentional — they say "no model in this category meets the bar for this task." If a new open-weight model changes that, flip the cell.
- Effort levels in recommendations should be defensible: minimal/low for trivial tasks, medium for normal work, high/xhigh for hard tasks, max only for autonomy. Don't recommend xhigh for "tiny edits" — that's a quality signal that something is off.

## Operational notes

- The dashboard is a **single self-contained HTML file** with JSON embedded in a script tag. No build step. No external data files.
- Daily run target time: ~10 minutes of research, ~1k tokens out, well within $1/day on Anthropic API.
- If a daily run fails, the previous `dashboard.html` is unchanged — no destructive operations.
- GitHub Pages can host `dashboard.html` directly for browser access from anywhere.

## Update cadence

- **Daily**: model/policy/harness deltas, changelog append, executive summary refresh.
- **Weekly** (manual review): trends, headline stats sanity check, strategy recalibration.
- **On major release** (e.g., new frontier model): manual review of `executive_summary` and `strategy.current_recommendation`.
